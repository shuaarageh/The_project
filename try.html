<h3>Treadmill</h3>
<p> Without a doubt, the most common cardio piece of equipment in every gym.

It’s basically a piece of machine designed for running in the same space via the use of a rotating belt.
 This actually dates back centuries to standard mills, which were manually operated by animals or humans.
They usually run either via a flywheel or, more commonly, via an electric motor.
 There are plenty of treadmills available even for home-gym use that are quite affordable.
 Just don’t forget to check pros and cons and ‘real-reviewers’ experience.</p>

 <h3>Dumbbells</h3>
 <p>Dumbbells are possibly the most known free weights in the world.
They are used in weight training either individually, or in pairs.
 The handle is usually made of iron or steel and the weight parts are either made of iron, steel, cement or rubber.

These dumbbells can also be adjustable, meaning you can change the desired weight on each dumbbell by unscrewing and re-screwing the weight plates from the handle.</p>

<h3> Suspension Trainer </h3>
<p> Maybe you have already heard about the suspension training.
   It has become very popular in the last couple of years and suspension trainers are in great demand as of now.
   They are mainly for home-gym enthusiasts. Basically, it’s set of straps and handles, which are suspended off of the floor, similarly to gymnastic rings.
  They are great for stability and overall strength.</p>

<h3>Resistance Bands</h3>
<p>Resistance bands are basically stretchy pieces of plastic that use different weights of resistance.
   Resistance training increases one’s strength, for example by using them for bicep curls.</p>

<h3> Stability Ball</h3>
<p>Also called exercise ball or Swiss ball is a huge and versatile piece of fitness equipment that can be used for various exercise for the entire body. It is a great tool to increase one’s stability, overall balance and core strength.
  It’s funny that you can even lose calories with a stability ball simply by bouncing up and down on it like a crazy person.</p>
