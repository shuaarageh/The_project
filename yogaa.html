<h1> YOGA </h1>

<h3> Downward Facing Dog: </h3>
<p> keep both toes pointed towards the front of your mat
 and sink your heels toward the floor </p>

<h3> Bridge Pose: </h3>
<p> is a gentle way to start exploring spine extension,
 also known as a backbend. It's a good idea to start incorporating
 this type of movement because it improves the mobility of your spine and counters the effects of too much sitting.
 If bridge seems too intense, try a ​supported bridge with a block.
 Remember to root into the feet, which helps you use your leg muscles to support the pose.</p>

 <h3>Cat Stretch: </h3>
 <p> may be the most important pose you learn when starting yoga,
 especially if you have back pain
  spinal extension followed by spinal flexion. Moving back and forth ​awakens and warms the back, improves body awareness,
  and is a basic introduction to how to do a vinyasa sequence by coordinating your movements to your breath.</p>

  <h3> Child's Pose: </h3>
  <p>it's the position you assume whenever you need a break during a yoga class. If you ever feel fatigued,
  you don't have to wait for the teacher to call for a break. Just move into child's pose and rejoin the class when you're ready.
  It provides a gentle stretch for the back, hips, thighs, and ankles, but does not challenge strength or balance.</p>

  <h3> Cobra Pose: </h3>
<p>full cobra with straight arms offers a deeper backbend,
 you'll build more back strength by doing low cobras in which you lift your chest without pressing into your hands.
 Root into feet, lengthen out through the crown of the head, and broaden through collar bones as you lift the sternum.
 It's also key to anchor your pelvis to the floor before you lift up.</p>

 <h3> Plank Pose: </h3>
 <p> It might seem strange to call plank a balancing pose since the risk of falling over is pretty minimal,
 but it gets to the heart of what this pose is about core strength. A strong core is essential for so many yoga poses, including standing balances,
 arm balances, and plank is an excellent way to on work your stability and stamina. Aim to keep hips and spine in a neutral position.</p>
